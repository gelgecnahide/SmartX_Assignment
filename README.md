# Rest API testing using Cypress framework

# Prerequisites

The first thing we need to do is to setup our environment. So here are some things that you should have to start this project:

VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download </br>
NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm </br>
NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download



## Use

1. Checkout the project from git - git clone https://github.com/gelgecnahide/SmartX_Assignment.git
2. Navigate to the project root directory -cypress-api-automation-framework
3. Install dependencies with `npm install` 
4. See scripts in `package.json` and run the tests. The main ones are
* `npx cypress open` - runs Cypress in GUI mode
* `npx cypress run --record --key cc5f50b8-fdb3-4896-b068-9e201266fbfa` - runs cypress test in headless mode and displays the results in a report in Cypress Dashboard. Navigate https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/hk45yu/runs to see the results.
